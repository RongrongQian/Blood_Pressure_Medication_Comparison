# Comparative Antihypertensive Efficacy of Ramipril, Lisinopril, and Moexipril
Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) is a critical clinical metric, representing the arterial pressure during a heartbeat. Elevated SBP, or hypertension, is a primary risk factor for major cardiovascular events, including stroke and heart attack. This report aims to conduct an exploration and comparison of the efficacy of three common antihypertensive drugs: Ramipril, Lisinopril, and Moexipril, in reducing SBP through a small scale clinical study.

The primary objective of this report is to perform a comprehensive and in depth statistical analysis to:

  1. Assess Drug Efficacy: Determine if there are statistically significant differences among the three drugs in reducing mean SBP.
  2. Identify the Optimal Medication: If significant differences exist, identify which drug demonstrates superior performance in reducing blood pressure.
  3. Examine Randomization Assumption: Evaluate the baseline data to check if participants were successfully randomized to the three treatment groups.
     
This report will employ an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model, using the baseline SBP as a covariate. This approach allows for a more precise evaluation of the true effects of each drug by controlling for initial differences in blood pressure levels.
